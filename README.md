<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the FakeChat project up and running on your machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - FakeChat is developed in Java, so you need to have the JDK installed. Download and install the latest version of JDK from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use a version management tool like SDKMAN to manage different JDK versions.

2. **Android Studio**
   - Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development. You can download it from [the official Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

3. **Git**
   - Git is a version control system required for cloning the project repository. You can download Git from [the official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Process

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - First, clone the FakeChat repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/Piqulsky/FakeChat.git
     ```
   - This will create a directory named `FakeChat` with all the project files.

2. **Open the Project in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen or go to `File` > `Open` if you're already inside Android Studio.
   - Navigate to the cloned `FakeChat` directory and select it. Android Studio will begin to import the project.

3. **Sync the Project with Gradle**
   - Once the project is opened, Android Studio will automatically sync it with Gradle. If it doesn't start automatically, go to `File` > `Sync Project with Gradle Files`.
   - This process downloads all the necessary dependencies specified in the `build.gradle` files.

4. **Set Up an Android Virtual Device (AVD)**
   - If you don't have a physical device to test the application, set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) by going to `Tools` > `AVD Manager` and following the prompts to create a new virtual device.

5. **Run the Application**
   - To run the FakeChat application, click the green "Run" button (or press `Shift + F10`). Select the device you want to run the app on (either a connected physical device or an AVD).
   - Android Studio will build the project and launch the application on the selected device.

Now you're ready to explore the codebase, make modifications, and contribute to the FakeChat project.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Chatting

<img src="images/Picture1.png" alt="Chat">

**Chat view** in FakeChat allows users to simulate a realistic chat environment with various customizable options. Below are the key functionalities available in the Chatting interface:

- **Avatar Customization:**
  - The avatar of the person you are messaging can be customized. To change the avatar, tap on the current avatar icon. This action will open the photo gallery, where you can select a new image to represent the contact. This feature helps in tailoring the chat interface to match your project's requirements.

- **Activity Status:**
  - Below the avatar, the current activity status of the person is displayed. This status indicates whether the person is "online" or not. If the person is online, the status will appear in green; if not, it will be gray. This visual cue helps in simulating the dynamic nature of real-time chat applications.

- **Message History:**
  - Users can scroll through earlier messages in the chat to review the conversation history. This feature is useful for creating a sense of continuity and context in the simulated chat.

- **Writing New Messages:**
  - To write a new message, use the text input field at the bottom of the chat view. Once you enter your message, you can simulate sending it. Each message sent can be customized with a status indicator below it, showing whether the message has been read or not, adding an extra layer of realism.

- **Call Functionality:**
  - In the lower left corner of the chat view, there is a call button. Tapping this button switches the interface to a fake call view, simulating a call with the contact. This feature is ideal for scenarios where a voice conversation is needed in the narrative.

- **Exiting Call View:**
  - To leave the fake call view, press the red disconnect button. This action ends the call simulation and returns you to the chat interface.

- **Exiting Chat View:**
  - To exit the chat view and return to the main interface or previous screen, press the button in the upper left corner. This button acts as a back navigation control, allowing you to leave the chat session.

These features provide a comprehensive and customizable experience, enabling users to create realistic chat scenarios for their projects. Whether you're simulating a conversation or a call, FakeChat offers a versatile platform to enhance your creative work.

### Chats

<img src="images/Picture10.png" alt="Chats">

**Other chats view** in FakeChat allows users to manage multiple chat conversations, each customizable with unique attributes. Here's an overview of the functionalities available in this section:

- **Chats Name:**
  - This view is labeled with a name, which can represent the app name or a group, similar to naming conventions in real chat applications.

- **Navigating Between Chats:**
  - Users can switch between different chat conversations using the arrow buttons located on the right side of each chat entry. This navigation method provides an intuitive way to explore various chats, whether they're individual or group conversations.

- **Read Status Indicators:**
  - The name of each chat serves as a visual indicator of whether the chat has been read. If the chat has unread messages, the name appears in bold text, signaling that there are new, unseen messages. If all messages have been read, the text will appear in regular font weight. This feature mimics the notification style of real messaging apps, enhancing the authenticity of the simulation.

- **Editing Conversations and Visual Aspects:**
  - To edit conversations and customize visual elements, users can press the button located in the upper right corner of the screen. This action takes the user into an editor mode, where they can:
    - Modify the content of any chat conversation, including adding, deleting, or altering messages.
    - Change the visual aspects of the chat interface, such as chat names, avatars, and other aesthetic elements, allowing for a fully tailored chat experience.

These features provide users with comprehensive control over multiple conversations within FakeChat. Whether simulating a group chat or one-on-one conversation, these tools help create a believable and engaging chat environment for your projects.

### Editor

  - **Managing Messages:**
    - **Adding Messages:** Add new messages to the chat by tapping the message bubble with three dots. This opens an option to insert a new message.
    - **Editing Messages:** Each message bubble can be edited directly. You can:
      - Modify the text content of the message.
      - Toggle whether the message is marked as read or unread using a switch.
      - Change the author of the message via a switch input in the middle, which will adjust the message bubble’s color accordingly.
    - **Delayed Messages:** Add delayed messages by selecting the message bubble with a clock icon. These messages are always sent by the other side. Below the editable text, there’s an input field to set the delay in seconds before the message is delivered.

- **Adding New Chats:**
  - To create a new chat, tap the button at the bottom of the editor screen featuring a message bubble with a plus symbol. This will add a new chat entry to your list, allowing you to customize it as needed.

The Editor section allows for detailed and flexible management of chat conversations and their visual presentation, ensuring that FakeChat meets your specific project requirements.
